# 🌍 Mosaic

**Mosaic** is a social platform for globally-minded people to connect through shared experiences, stories, and cultural journeys. Built by travelers, for travelers — Mosaic helps people who have lived, worked, or wandered across borders share their personal narratives and find community with others who’ve done the same.

# Inspiration

After years of living, working, and dancing her way through more than 12 countries — from the U.S. to Europe to Southeast Asia, the creator of this app found that most platforms claiming to "connect people globally" felt impersonal, commercialized, or overrun with spam. Authenticity was missing.

Mosaic was born from a desire to bring storytelling back into the way we meet each other — not through shallow swipes or algorithmic noise, but by highlighting lived experiences and the places that shape us.

# 💡 The Problem

Most social or cultural connection apps today suffer from:

- Overwhelming ads and bots
- Lack of meaningful discovery
- No real sense of shared experience
- A feed that prioritizes influencers over individuals

# ✅ The Solution

**Mosaic** creates space for:

- ✏️ Mini-stories: Users can post short reflections tied to countries they’ve lived in.

- 🌍 Profile mosaics: Each user curates a personal map of where they’ve lived, worked, or studied.

- 📖 Shared histories: Discover people with overlapping journeys and cultural intersections.

- 💬 Commenting & Connection: Engage with others’ stories directly — no “likes,” just thoughtful conversation.
